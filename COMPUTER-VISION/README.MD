# Deep Learning for Computer Vision Curriculum

- Repetition of neural networks and deep learning from week before
	- Architecture
	- Loss function
	- Optimizier

- History of convolutional neural networks
	- Inspiration from visual processing in the brain
		- From retina: neurons encoding point-wise brightness
		- Via early cortext: neurons encoding edges / oriented lines
		- To high-level cortext: neurons encoding increasingly complex concepts with decreasing spatial resolution
	- Idea of CNNs or CNN-like architectures is old
		- Hubel and Wiesel
		- Fukushima's neocognitron
		- LeCun
	- Image classification was first domain in which neural networks vastly outperformed previous machine learning approaches and even humans
		- AlexNet (2015)
		- Backpropagation for training (Rumelhart and Hinton)
		- Vast amounts of digital data for training
		- GPUs for compute power

- How images are represented on a computer
	- RGB
	- Lossless (e.g., PNG) vs lossy (e.g., JPEG) formats
	- Histograms
	- Exercises: Get experience working with images
		- Loading images from file (or dataset?)
		- Use colors as examples of different channels
			- Plot each channel separately
		- Convert RGB to grayscale
		- Plot histograms
		- Normalization, brightness, contrast
		- Rotations, flipping, etc.
		- Apply Gaussian filter / edge detection filter
			- Example of convolution
		- Load PNG, save as JPEG and reload, then look at difference between PNG and JPEG: illustration of loss

- Image classification
	- Generally: From image (NxN) to class probabilities (scalar)
		- Compression / encoding (foreshadowing encoder-decoder networks; U-Net, autoencoders, etc.)
	- Purely convolutional
		- Readout layer (1x1 convolution) to go from "image" to distribution over classes
	- Concept of field-of-view
		- Max-pooling: cheap increase in field-of-view
		- Less frequently used: atrous / dilated convolutions
	- Datasets
		- MNIST
		- CIFAR
		- ImageNet
	- Architectures
		- AlexNet
		- ResNet
			- Skip connections / residual learning: important when training "very deep networks"
			- Still widely used as pre-trained model / backbone
		- VGG
			- Prefer many small convolutions over few large convolutions
	- Metrics
		- Confusion matrix (easily extends from binary to multi-class case)
		- Accuracy (careful: random predictions can have high / low expected accuracy in case of unbalanced datasets)
		- Precision + recall
		- Sensitivity + specificity
		- F1 score
	- Exercise:
		- Use Umberto's FastionMNIST example
		- Inspect test images and corresponding feature maps
		- Repeat without batch normalization
		- How does the CNN perform compared to a human?
			- Is it easily confused by pixel-wise noise? Humans are not
				- Implement generator with data augmentations
			- Does it excell in low-contrast settings (where humans no longer see anything)?

- Semantic segmentation
	- Per-pixel classification: from image (NxN) to image (NxN)
	- Foreground vs. background
	- Multiple semantic classes: 
	- Problems:
		- Assumes that each pixel can be clearly assigned to a class
		- In practice: Pixels at boundaries hard to classify
			- Often need to handle annotation noise
	- Examples:
		- Biomedical applications: 
		- Self-driving car: scene segmentation (?)
	- Datasets
		- Any dataset for instance segmentation:
			- COCO
			- Cityscapes Dataset
	- Architectures
		- Purely convolutional network
		- U-Net:
			- encoder to learn low-resolution, but high-level concepts
			- decoder to project high-level concepts back to high resolution
			- upsampling (e.g., nearest neighbor or linear interpolation)
			- upconvolution / transposed convolution
				- important also for image generation (autoencoder, etc.)
		- DeepLabV3:
		- Segment anything:
	- Metrics
		- Binary cross-entropy
		- Distance transform-based loss
		- Dice score
		- [[Jaccard index]] / [[Jaccard index|IoU]]
	- Instance segmentation through intra-class pixel clustering (e.g., connected components or watershed transform)
	- Exercises
		- No existing exercises?

		- KerasCV DeepLabV3 example: https://keras.io/examples/vision/deeplabv3_plus/

- Object detection
	- Image classification: image to class 
	- Object detection: image to set of (bounding box, class) pairs
	- Question: How to do this efficiently and 
	- Architectures
		- Region CNN (R-CNN) family
		- RetinaNet
		- YOLO
	- Datasets:
		- PASCAL Visual Object Classes (PASCAL VOC)
		- Cityscapes Datasets
		- COCO
	- Metrics
		- Repetition of [[Jaccard index]]
		- Mean average precision (mAP)
	- Exercises:
		- `Notebooks_CVAI/SW12/Notebooks/MS_COCO_mAP.ipynb`
			- Focus is on evaluation metrics (intersection over union, average precision, mean average precision)
		- Existing exercise: Part I of `Notebooks_CVAI/SW12/Notebooks/CVAI Jupyter Notebook SW12 - Object Detection.ipynb`
			- Notebook seems overly complex
			- TODO: Student tasks?
		- https://keras.io/examples/vision/yolov8/

- Instance segmentation (i.e., pixel classification + clustering)
	- Instance segmentations can be generated by semantic segmentation + heuristic approaches (e.g., connected components or watershed)
	- Instead: Group voxels by semantics AND object identity
		- Combination of semantic segmentation and object detection
	- Architectures
		- Mask R-CNN
	- Image to text
	- Others:
		- Video instead of images
		- Image generation
	- Exercises:
		- Existing exercises: Part II of `Notebooks_CVAI/SW12/Notebooks/CVAI Jupyter Notebook SW12 - Object Detection.ipynb` claims to be about instance segmentation. But the code only seems to do object detection?!

- Image-text
	- Imaging captioning
	- CLIP (Radford et al. 2021):
		- Learning image representations from text
		- Zero-shot performance on ImageNet matches ResNet (without making use of the ImageNet training data)
	- Exercises:
		- No existing exercises?
